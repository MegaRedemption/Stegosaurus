{Hello!*Greetings!*Dear friend,*To whom it may concern,}

{REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE*HELP NEEDED*PLEASE HELP*URGENT ACTION REQUIRED} --{STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL*TOP SECRET*TOP_SECRET*CONFIDENTIAL}

I{ am*, } Dr. Bakare Tunde,{ the * }cousin of {internationally*globally} {renowned*revered} Nigerian Astronaut, Air Force Major {Abache Tunde*Jay-Jay Okocha*Usain Bolt*Muhammadu Buhari}. He was {the*our} first African in space when he {made a secret flight*performed a top secret mission*had a confidential flight*blasted off} to the {Salyut*Dasvidaniya*Putnik*LaChiem} {0*1*2*3*4*5*6*7}{1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8} space station in 197{1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8}. He was on a {later*subsequent} {Soviet*USSR} spaceflight, {Soyuz*Garchak*SkyHawk*Space Maiden} T-{0*1*2*3*4*5*6*7}{1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8}{Z*CH*R*L} to the secret Soviet military space station {Salyut*Dasvidaniya*Putnik*LaChiem} {1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8}{T*-Alpha*BB*RH} in 198{1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8}. He was {stranded*left*abandoned*grounded} there in 1990 when the {Soviet Union*USSR} {was dissolved*fell apart*ended their program*cut funding}. His other Soviet {crew members*teammates*team members*colleagues} returned to earth on the {Soyuz*Garman*Hughner*Orchanz} T-{1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8}Z, but his place was taken up by {return cargo*moon rocks*dead aliens*precious cargo}. There have been {occasional*sporadic} Progrez supply {flights*missions} to {keep him going*resupply him*support him*ensure his survival} since that {time long ago*time}. He is {in good humor*in good spirits*very cheerful*ok}, but {wants*is patiently waiting} to {come home*return home*come back to earth*return to his family}.
